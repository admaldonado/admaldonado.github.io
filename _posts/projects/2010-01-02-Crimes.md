This technology transfer project (subject to a "non-disclousure agreement") was also made in collaboration with the company Gobile. Within this project we developed novel data mining methods for predicting the spatio-temporal occurrence of the crimes of a city based on the historical record of crimes. We started from the fact that crimes do not distribute uniformly across the city. They tend to concentrate in some areas and at some time intervals. Police forces used this knowledge when making decisions over the assignment of the scarce resources. However, the application of data mining and machine learning techniques provides a rigorous approach to deal with this information and allows making better-informed predictions and decisions.
