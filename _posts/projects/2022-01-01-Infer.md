This project proposes the development of a probabilistic programming language 
compatible with a distributed computing model. This language will be implemented as 
an API so the user can mix probabilistic and non-probabilistic code in their application, 
and it will be integrated into Spark and Flink, two platforms for processing large 
volumes of data. The language will be developed as an open source software project 
freely available to the scientific and professional community interested in the use of 
machine learning (ML) techniques on large volumes of data.
