InferPy is a Python package for probabilistic modeling with deep neural networks. InferPy defines a user-friendly API which trades-off model complexity with ease of use, unlike other libraries whose focus is on dealing with very general probabilistic models at the cost of having a more complex API. In particular, Inferpy allows to define, learn and evaluate general hierarchical probabilistic models containing deep neural networks in a compact and simple way. InferPy is built on top of Tensorflow, Edward2 and Keras.
