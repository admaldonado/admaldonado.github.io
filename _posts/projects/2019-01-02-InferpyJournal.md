InferPy is a high-level Python API for probabilistic modeling built on top of
Edward and Tensorflow. InferPy, which is strongly inspired by Keras, focuses
on being user-friendly by using an intuitive set of abstractions that make easy
to deal with complex probabilistic models. It should be seen as an interface
rather than a standalone machine-learning framework. In general, InferPy
has the focus on enabling flexible data processing, easy-to-code probabilistic
modeling, scalable inference and robust model validation.
