Using the AMIDST Toolbox, we prototyped models for early recognition of traffic
manoeuvre intentions using object oriented graphical models. Data was collected by car on-board sensors giving rise to a
large and quickly evolving data stream. This work was performed in collaboration
with [DAIMLER](https://www.daimler.com) and [Hugin Expert](https://www.hugin.com/).
