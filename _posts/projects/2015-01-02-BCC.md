Using the AMIDST Toolbox, we developed a model to do risk prediction in credit operations. 
Data was collected continuously and reported on a monthly basis, this gives rise to a 
streaming data classification problem. This work has been performed in collaboration 
with one of our partners, the Spanish bank [BCC](https://www.bcc.es/).
